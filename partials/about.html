<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a software developer, always looking to increase my skills both in depth and breadth. I recently completed a Web Development internship at Prosper I.T. Consulting and completed a Software Development Bootcamp at Portland's Tech Academy. I have a Bachelor's in Government and Legal Studies from Claremont McKenna College and a background in advertising, non-profits and childcare/education. <br>
<br>In my spare time, I enjoy paddling dragon boats up and down the Wilammette and listening to stand-up comedy.</p>
