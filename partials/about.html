<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a software developer, always looking to increase my skills both in depth and breadth. I have Bachelor's Degree in Government and Legal Studies and a background in advertising, non-profits and childcare/education. <br>
<br>In my spare time I enjoy paddling Dragon Boats up and down the Wilammette, listening to stand-up comedy and, in the immortal words of Billy Idol, "dancing with myself" to just about anything that's not smooth jazz or Gregorian chants.</p>
